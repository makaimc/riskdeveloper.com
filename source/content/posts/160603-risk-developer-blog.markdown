meta: The Risk Developer blog provides walkthroughs for risk management scenarios.


[Risk Developer](http://www.riskdeveloper.com/) is a new website by
[Luke Makai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukemakai), Associate Vice 
President handling risk management for the Americas division at 
[SMBC](http://www.smbc.co.jp/global/), and 
[Matt Makai](http://www.mattmakai.com/), Developer Evangelist Manager - West
Coast at [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/).

We are focusing our writing on risk management from both finance and software
development technical sides. Initially, most of our work will go into
fleshing out the [table of contents](/table-of-contents.html) page before
we handle specific step-by-step tutorials on this blog.

Let us know what you think on on 
Twitter [@mattmakai](https://twitter.com/mattmakai) or send us an
email at matthew.makai@gmail.com.
